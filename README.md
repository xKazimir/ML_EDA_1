# Exploratory Data Analysis Project

This project follows the tutorial from the YouTube video "Exploratory Data Analysis using Python":  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sZFkPw87ng

The goal of this project is to analyze and understand a dataset using basic Python data science tools. The project uses Jupyter Notebook and popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Description

In this notebook, we:

- Load a dataset from a CSV file
- Inspect and understand the structure of the data
- Clean the data by handling missing values and formatting columns
- Filter and group the data for specific analysis (e.g. 50-mile races only)
- Calculate summary statistics like mean and count
- Sort and filter aggregated results
- Add new calculated columns (such as race season based on race month)
- Create visualizations to explore relationships and trends

This project is a good starting point for building an EDA portfolio in Python.

## File Structure

- `notebook.ipynb` – The main notebook with all code and analysis
- `.gitignore` – Used to exclude large files like CSV data from version control
- `requirements.txt` – (Optional) A list of Python libraries used

> Note: The CSV file is ignored from the repository due to GitHub’s file size limit.

## How to Run This Project
